                <p> So I work at a top-tier convince store in the Midwest, and tonight around one a.m. I went to see one of my managers on his overnight shift. On my way inside a man stopped me and asked if I could purchase him a black and mild, and they're only about a dollar so I told him "sure." I went inside, talked to my manager for a bit, then bought some chocolate cupcakes, as well as a cigarrilo for myself and the man outside. I go outside and give the guy his cigarillo and try to light mine with some matches. It was too windy however so he let me borrow his lighter, which was nice. We were just hanging out, chatting and he told me about why he was stuck outside that night. I offered him a cupcake and he obliged and thanked me, and I began eating the other one as well.As we were eating a man in a car pulls up. The man got out of the car, and threw his still lit cigarette butt at the feet of a homeless guy right next to us, causing the embers to scatter across the ground. He yelled some mean things at the homeless guy. On his way inside he walked past me and my new friend and started harassing us, telling us how he was from LA, California, and how we "ain't shit."It went on for maybe ten seconds as he made his way to the door, and I just laughed at him. He opened the door and I started walking towards him as he continued shouting at us. He said "what are you gonna do?" to which I smugly replied "I ain't gonna do nothing." I got to the door, standing right next to him, and peeked inside and told my manager to "get this guy his shit and get him outta here, or call the cops."He tried to tell my manager that I asked him for money (which obviously I did not). I told the guy that I worked at that store, and that the manager was my manager. He didn't seem to believe me but my manager backed me up. After that he got his cigarettes and got out of there pretty quick, but not before shouting at me and my new friend some more. All I said was "Come back and see me." He didn't seem to like that and said that he would.Shortly after he ran a red light to leave in a hurry, an officer showed up out of coincidence and went inside to use the restroom. I went back inside to get a cup of water, right behind the officer. But as I came out of the store my friend had run off, to avoid getting in trouble for loitering. I wanted to say good bye to him and to wish him luck, but instead just got in my car and made my way home. </p>
